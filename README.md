# ML101 - Machine Learning Mastery
My Course on Machine Learning that I teach.

This course teaches advanced theory including some mathematics with practical exercises to promote deeper understanding.

Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course the students will:

    Have an in-depth understanding of the concepts of Machine Learning

    Be able to grasp, understand, and write machine learning code from scratch 

    Use Builtin Libraries available to build machine learning models

    Be able to analyze, build, and assess models on any dataset

    Be able to interpret and understand the black box behind model

    Understand the applications of data science by exhibiting the ability to work on different datasets and interpreting them.

What is the working system of this course?

    Strong concepts and theory linked to practical at the end of each module

    Easy Lectures for those starting from scratch

    Illustration and examples

    Hands-on exercises with tutorials

    Detailed explanations of how models work


What does this course cover?

    Introduction to machine learning: Overview of supervised and unsupervised learning

    Regression from scratch - Gradient Descent, Cost Function , Modelling

    Using Machine learning builtin library

    Feature Scaling

    Multivariate Regression 

    Polynomial Regression

    Over-fitting, Under-fitting and Generalization

    Bias Variance Tradeoff

    Cross Validation Strategy and Hyper-parameter tuning

    Grid Search 

    Learning Curves

    Decision Trees and introduction to other algorithms including neural network

    Exercises after each module


After completing the course, you will have enough knowledge and confidence to code machine learning algorithms from scratch and to use built-in library. This course is for all interested in learning data science and machine learning, there is no such pre req. This course is different from other courses in a manner that it teaches to code algorithms and also exposes you to the mathematics behind machine learning, this even includes tutorials at the end of each module so that students can do side by side practice with the instructor. It exposes you to practical real world datasets to work on and get started with new problems.


Who this course is for:

    Curious about Data Science
    People wishing to learn Machine Learning from scratch
    People of different domains - Business Analyst, Marketing, etc
    Seeking job in the areas of machine learning
